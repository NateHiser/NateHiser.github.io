  "description":"As a young student at the top of her class, it seemed as if nothing could stop Maricielo. Then she became pregnant at just 16 years old. Maricielo wrestled with the idea of abortion. Through some drastic events, she ended up attending weekly classes at the pre-natal center in Lima. Her counselor shared Godâ€™s love for her and that He had a purpose for her, even within a crisis situation. Today, Maricielo is a graduate of school and is the proud mother of a healthy, 3-month-old boy who is loved by all. Storytellers Marissa Dickey and Jamie Gessner capture Maricielo's dream to share with other girls that being a mother is a beautiful feeling, and she hopes to be a volunteer at a pre-natal center one day.",
