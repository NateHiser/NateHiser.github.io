  "description":"Born into a dysfunctional family, rejected by her biological father, abused by her stepfather, and eventually thrown out of the house by her mother, Elvira Cuevas Bol√≠var began life headed in the wrong direction. When she hit bottom, she began searching for God by reading the Bible. She annotated, highlighted, and treasured it as God began revealing Himself to her. Elvira was devastated when a thief reached into her taxi and stole the bag containing her precious Bible. But God had divinely appointed a Christian as her taxi driver. He reminded her that God sees everything and He is in control. The driver then pointed Elvira to a local Christian radio station - Radio Integridad - which fed her hunger for God's Word with solid Bible teaching. About three months later Elvira accepted Christ as her Savior and she transformed as she listened to Radio Integridad hours per day. Storyteller Jay York tracks Elvira's calling to reach taxistasg (taxi drivers) with the Gospel.",
