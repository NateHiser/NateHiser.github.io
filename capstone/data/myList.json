  "description":"Like many others do as a teenager, Carol made a list of all the character qualities she wanted in a husband. She was shocked when she realized that she herself didn't have many of the qualities herself. Storyteller Rose Finley tells us how Carol attended the Adventures in Waiting class, a program written by an ABWE missionary. Through her time there, God showed Carol that the void in her life, which she thought a boyfriend would fill, should be filled with her relationship with Jesus. At age 21 Carol now helps teach th Adventures in Waitin  class to groups of 25 students. She helps them to find fulfillment in Christ, and how to stay emotionally, mentally, and spiritually pure for marriage.",
