  "description":"Battling with the idea of following in his father’s footsteps, Lucho neglected the idea of ever becoming a pastor. However, that all changed when God changed his heart and ignited a passion for sharing the Gospel. Storyteller Josiah McConville tells how doors were opened for Lucho to be the leader of the youth group which ultimately led him to enroll in Seminary. Throughout his years in school he met his wife Rosa and together they started New Life Baptist Church. Understanding the eternal weight of leading a church body, Lucho went back to school to complete his master’s in expository preaching. Rosa followed his lead and is currently working to complete her master’s in counseling. Their ministry within the Chorrillos area in Lima, Peru bears the fruit of their Seminary education as they have been able to see God use their training to restore marriages through their counseling sessions for other families.",
