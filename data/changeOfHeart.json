  "description":"As a student at La Molina Christian school in Lima, Peru, Sara Lu saw Christianity as just a bunch of rules, and openly rebelled against them. But through the unconditional love from her parents and the teachers at La Molina—some of them not even her own teachers, like mentor and best friend, Stephanie Pace—Sara discovered the grace part of the gospel, and along the way found her heart for teaching. Today, she is the mother to a four-year-old, crazy little boy; and as she strives to raise her son to have a servant’s heart, she also dreams of one day opening Christian schools to teach other, underprivileged kids who have little access to good education, showing them Christ’s love. Storyteller Naomi Harward shares this touching story of a woman's love for children.",
