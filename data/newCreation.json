  "description":"Marlen has known pain and suffering but is using that to help other woman who were in her situation. Growing up in an abusive home, she left to pursue a career. She fell in love and got pregnant, but because she thought she had no other option, she aborted the baby. For years she suffered from post abortion trauma which devastated her life. After finding God, she realized the true meaning of sin and what she had done. She still struggled with the decision of her past until she found out about the pre-natal center. There she received strong biblical counseling and healing followed. She is now the co-director and soon to be director of the prenatal center. She also trains counselors and teaches classes. Because she is not able to have children now, she wants to help other women to have families and heal. Storyteller Hannah Bohrer captures this honest and vulnerable story of victory through pain and suffering.",
