  "description":"Kind eyes and a deep voice are the first things that stand out upon introduction, says Storyteller Stephanie Simmons. Jorge Quintana is a soldier of Jesus Christ fighting for the souls of men in the trenches of Peru. Years of hard work left him with everything he could have wanted; except joy. Money, success, recognition and possessions left Jorge feeling empty and dissatisfied. After hearing the Gospel at a breakfast put on by New Life Church, Jorge accepted Christ and what was once empty was now filled. Now he is attending seminary to learn more about this great God and seeking Godâ€™s direction for the next steps in his life.",
